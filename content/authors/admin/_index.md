I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Particle Physics Phenomenology at Durham University and I am carrying out the second half of my PhD work as a Temporary Research Fellow at the University of Turin. 
Previously I obtained a Masters with Merit in Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces at Imeprial College in London. I have lived and worked in several different cities in Italy and the UK. PROVAAAA!!!
